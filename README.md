Data Science Project that awarded me with a certificate - **Datacamp's Data Scientist Associate**

## Background
This is a **fictional dataset** and problem. 
The university started offering online courses to reach a wider range of students. The university wanted me to help them understand enrollment trends.
I helped them to identify what contributes to higher enrollment. In particular, whether the course type (online or classroom) is a factor.

## Competencies and Packages Included
- **Data Management:** Pandas, NumPy, OneHotEncoder
- **Exploratory Analysis**
- **Statistical Experimentation:** sklearn - ColumnTransformer, GridSearchCV
- **Modeling**: sklearn - LinearRegression, RandomForestRegressor
- **Communication and Visualization:** Seaborn, Matplotlib
